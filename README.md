Basic usage
--------

Use the .ipnyb notebooks to train and analyze all models

Summary
--------

We propose a simple way of extending Hamiltonian Neural Networks so as to model physical systems with dissipative forces. We call this model a Dissipative Hamiltonian Neural Network (D-HNN) because it adds support for dissipative dynamics.

Dependencies
--------
 * PyTorch
 * NumPy
 * ImageIO
 * Scipy
